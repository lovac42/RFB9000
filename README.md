## Limits and Bans:
There is a limit of 200 characters per 100 seconds or so. So if you don't play nice, you will get banned. Background processing is supported in the configs, but please try not to read and write to the same cards. You may review deckA while processing deckB.

## Warning:
This addon was created as a guide, do not rely on it to be accurate in anyway. I'm sure most of you have heard about the stories of duck vegetables. What translation algorithms churn out can be hilarious, but when that is shared with unsuspecting users, it becomes pernicious when the user drills themself with these erroneous decks.
