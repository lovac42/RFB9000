## Warning:
This addon was created as a guide, do not rely on it to be accurate in anyway. I'm sure most of you have heard about the stories of duck vegetables. What translation algorithms churn out can be hilarious, but when that is shared with unsuspecting users, it becomes pernicious when the user drills themself with these erroneous decks.
